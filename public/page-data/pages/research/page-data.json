A few of my interests include:</p>\n<p>The generalization of optimization in Euclidean space to methods in Hilbert spaces using RKHS. These include, but are not limited to, kernel embeddings of distributions and kernel machine learning - equipping us with a propitious tool for solving a wide range of problems in supervised and unsupervised, large-scale machine learning. Additionally, I’m interested in the associated research using Fast-Fourier transforms and random matrix theory to make computational advances.</p>\n<p>Additionally, I have become interested in the research surrounding security and privacy. The advent of information and computational technology has given us a wealth of information in the world today. Owing to this, there is an imminent need and importance for privacy. <span class=\"katex\"><span class=\"katex-mathml\"><math xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML\"><semantics><mrow><mi>ϵ</mi></mrow><annotation encoding=\"application/x-tex\">\\epsilon</annotation></semantics></math></span><span class=\"katex-html\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"base\"><span class=\"strut\" style=\"height:0.43056em;vertical-align:0em;\"></span><span class=\"mord mathnormal\">ϵ</span></span></span></span>-differential privacy and other statistical and mathematical methods of examining risk in sensitive databases are particularly of interest. It also includes using locally-linear embeddings for ensuring privacy in deep learning networks; and, examining Renyi divergence metrics in differential privacy.</p>\n<p>As a quantitative analyst at Goldman Sachs, my work revolved around the axes of stochastic calculus, nonparametric statistics, data-mining and financial derivatives; where I used feature engineering techniques to efficiently infer latent behaviour of financial products to market risk exposure.</p>\n<p>Footnote: This is a little outdated. </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Research","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/research/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["13018520","251939775","401334301"]}
