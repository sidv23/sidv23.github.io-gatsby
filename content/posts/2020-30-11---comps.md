This is a test page. I'm adding some more text here to look at the live preview. Adding some more text here to check.

This is some example of math $\alpha$

$$
\mathbb{P}f \stackrel{\bullet}{=} \int_{\mathbb{R}^d}f(\boldsymbol x)d\mathbb P(\boldsymbol x)
$$


# This is an example header
Something
## Section 1
This is is some text in section 1


### Subsection 1
This is some more text. Dunno what else to add here.

#### This is probably going to be rendered as code.

Some more text.

Something else

This is an itemized list point.
1. Point \#1
1. Point \#2
1. Point \#3
1. ...

This is a bullet list:
* Point \#1
* Point \#2
* Point \#3
* ...
